## **_How to Play_**

POVMAZE is a first-person game where the player's view is from within the maze. The controls for the game are as follows:

Use the arrow keys to move forward, back, left, and right.
Press Q to turn left, and E to turn right.
Hold down the Shift key to sprint.
The player must navigate through the maze to reach the end. Along the way, they will encounter obstacles and challenges that they must overcome to progress. The game is designed to be challenging, so the player must be strategic and use their wits to make it to the end.
